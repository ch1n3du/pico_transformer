# pico-transformer (wip)

This is a rough attempt at following Peter Bloem's [transformers from scratch](https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers) tutorial.
Check [`notebooks/transformer_from_scratch.ipynb`](./notebooks/transformer_from_scratch.ipynb) for the code.

There are a lot of comments because I was trying to use the tutorial to also learn PyTorch.

## what next?

I need to actual use the `TransformerBlock` in a model.
